# Assignmment 4 - instaPy

## Getting Started
The python package may be installed using pip by running the following command in the root directory of the project
```bash
pip install .
```
This will also install all the dependencies required to run the different functions in this package.
Once the package has been installed in your system can for example apply a 50% sepia filter to an image by running
```bash
instapy -se --level 0.5 -f <input image> -o <output image>
```
for a complete overview of the command-line interface you may refer to
```bash
instapy --help
```

## Tests
Unit tests are contained in the `/test` subdirectory and are expected to be ran using the pytest package in the following way
```bash
pytest test_instapy.py
```

## Benchmarks/Reports
Reports of benchmarks comparing the speed of all the different implementations of the filters are located in `/reports`
and may be fully regenerated by running the python scripts located in `/report_scripts`. Please note that while the comments will be re-inserted, they perhaps unsurprisingly not be updated according to the new benchmark numbers, which may differ slightly from when i performed the benchmarking on my computer.

## Project Structure
|Directory|Description| 
|---|---|
|`/bin`| Contains the python file with the command-line user interface |
|`/img`| Contains the example image `rain.jpg` as well as any images generated when testing my implementation |
|`/instapy`||
|`/profiling_scripts`| Contains the scripts which perform the timings and generates the reports for problem 4.0 |
|`/report_scripts`| Contains the scripts which perform the timings and generates the reports of the different filter implementations|
|`/reports`| Contains all of the reports that are produced by the scripts in `/report_scripts` and `/profiling_scripts` |
|`/test`| Contains the unit tests for the instapy color2gray and color2sepia functions. Intended to be ran with pytest |


## Profiling Warm-up
The scripts produced in the profiling warmup are all located in `/profiling_scripts`, and running them will automatically update the reports located in the `/reports` directory.
