Comment: In this case, the implementation using Numba and Numby quite similar performance with
Numpy winning out by a factor 2. However, the numba code is literally a copy-paste of the
python implementation and the @njit decorator is responsible for the entirety of the performance
increase. 

In contrast, the numpy implementation required me to re-formulate the computation in a way which 
adheres to the numpy way of doing things. 

However, in this case numpy also offers the most elegant solution to the problem, requiring only 
a single line of code.
