Comment: In this case, the implementation using Numba and Numby quite similar performance with
Numba winning out by a factor 4. Furthermore, the numba code is literally a copy-paste of the
python implementation and the @njit decorator is responsible for the entirety of the performance
increase. 

In contrast, the numpy implementation required me to re-formulate the computation in a way which 
adheres to the numpy way of doing things. This re-formulation does however also turn out to be
much, much shorter and perhaps more elegant.

Also note that these benchmarks do not take into account the one-time overhead incurred by the Numba
implementation due to its just-in-time compilation which happens the first time the function 
is called.
